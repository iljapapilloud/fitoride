![Scan to get to the web app](qr-code.png)

Simple app and software for the static bike fitting as part of JugendForscht (2023). 

Based on biophysical data and the review of the scientific literature 
on bike-fitting, the application provides the necessary parameters for 
reliable bike-fitting in few steps. 

The application can be used for women and men aged 15 and over. 

The application works with the following platforms: 

**Windows 32 bit**: Fitorid-Windows-32bit.zip (unzip and install the exe file)

**Windows 64 bit**: Fitorid-Windows-64bit.zip (unzip and install the exe file)

**MacOS**: Fitorid_MacOS.zip (unstable; follow the install guide here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/running_on_macos.html)

**Linux**: Fitoride-Linux-64bit.zip (unzip and clic on the file Fitoride.x86_64)

**Android**: Fitoride-Android.zip (put both files on your mobile Android device and clic on "Fitoride.apk" to install)

The Godot-Project is available as "Fitoride-Godot3-Project.zip". It can 
be used to create the app for your own mobile phone or OS system. You 
need to have Godot 3.x installed on your computer. It does not work 
with Godot 4.x.

For non-compatible hardware (f.ex. IPhone), the following web app can be used ("wake up" the app if it has fallen asleep): https://iljapapilloud-fitoride-fitoride-app-2ekp1t.streamlit.app/

You can read the report on the findings in the document 
"IljaPapilloud-VNU_Schriftliche_Arbeit.pdf" (in German).
